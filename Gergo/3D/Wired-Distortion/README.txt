# Summary

A quick and dirty slip case for the Gergo mechanical keyboard sold by Gboards Heavy Industries. 'Slip case' since this is about as small of a case as you can get - few millimeters on each side, enough to cover the solder joints while the pcb sits flush on top. Works perfect for traveling!

# Post-Printing

In order to get this case to fit, youll need to sand off the nubs on the pcb. you dont have to get them completely flush, just close enough. i would recommend making sure your perimeter settings are dialed in, otherwise the sides may delaminate.
